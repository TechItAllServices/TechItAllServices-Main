Emergency Power Loss Protocol:

In the event of a power loss emergency, the following steps will be taken under Code Green Min:

1. Immediate Assessment:
   - Designate responsible personnel to assess the extent of the power loss.
   - Identify critical systems affected and prioritize restoration.

2. Communication Protocol:
   - Activate emergency communication channels to keep all relevant parties informed.
   - Provide regular updates on the status of power restoration efforts.

3. Temporary Power Sources:
   - Implement backup power sources to maintain essential operations.
   - Prioritize power allocation to critical areas such as emergency lighting and communication systems.

4. Isolation of Non-Essential Systems:
   - Temporarily isolate non-essential systems to conserve available power.
   - Evaluate and shut down any equipment that is not crucial for immediate operations.

5. Emergency Response Teams:
   - Mobilize emergency response teams to address any immediate safety concerns.
   - Ensure personnel are briefed on emergency procedures and evacuation routes.

6. Power Restoration Plan:
   - Develop a comprehensive plan for restoring power, considering safety protocols.
   - Coordinate with external utilities or service providers if necessary.

7. Regular Status Updates:
   - Provide regular status updates on power restoration progress.
   - Communicate any changes in the situation or projected timelines.

8. Testing and Validation:
   - Conduct thorough testing of restored power systems to ensure stability.
   - Validate that all critical functions are operational before returning to normal operations.

9. Post-Emergency Review:
   - Conduct a post-emergency review to analyze the cause of the power loss.
   - Identify areas for improvement in the emergency response and power systems.

Remember, Code Green Min is initiated to minimize the impact of power loss and ensure a swift and organized response. All personnel should be familiar with this protocol to act promptly and effectively in such situations.
