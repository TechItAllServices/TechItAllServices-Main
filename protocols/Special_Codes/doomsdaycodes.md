# Code Crimson - Critical Server Integrity Alert Protocol

Level: 6

Indicates a critical decline in server integrity, with only 5% remaining functional.

Emergency Shield Activation: Upon reaching 1% integrity, the emergency shield engages to mitigate imminent threats.

All non-essential operations are suspended, and resources are allocated to essential functions to prolong server stability.

Technicians are immediately dispatched to assess the situation and implement urgent repairs.

# Code Sapphire - Emergency Shield Activation with 1% Integrity

Level: 7

Activated when the server's integrity reaches 1%, triggering emergency shield protocols.

Despite the server's almost complete failure, the emergency shield system remains active to mitigate external threats during the evacuation process.

All communication and data transfer are suspended to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

Specialized response teams work urgently to neutralize any remaining threats and ensure the safety of personnel during evacuation.

Code Sapphire remains in effect until the evacuation is completed, after which recovery efforts can begin.

# Code Obsidian - Server Total Colapse Protocol

Level: 8

Signifies imminent complete server failure, with integrity reaching 0%.

Emergency Evacuation: Upon reaching 0% integrity, an emergency evacuation order is issued, and a 5-minute countdown begins before total system destruction.

Unlike Any other code. **THIS CAN NOT BE STOPED!!!**

All personnel are instructed to evacuate the servers immediately.

Emergency data backups are activated, and recovery teams prepare for salvage operations post-destruction.
